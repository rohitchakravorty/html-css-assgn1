				<strong>Introduction</strong>
				<p>
					On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones
					for
					HTML 5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML 5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities
					inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a
					comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which
					was
					the target date for recommendation.In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" specification
					HTML Living Standard. The W3C nevertheless continued its project to release HTML 5.

					On 16 September 2014, W3C moved HTML 5 to Proposed Recommendation.[30] On 28 October 2014, HTML 5
					was
					released as a W3C Recommendation,[31] bringing the specification process to completion.[2] On 1
					November
					2016, HTML 5.1 was released as a W3C Recommendation.[32] On 14 December 2017, HTML 5.2 was released
					as a
					W3C Recommendation.

		<p class="hero"> The W3C ceded authority over the HTML and DOM standards to WHATWG on 28 May 2019, recognizing that having 2
			standards is harmful.The HTML Living Standard is now authoritative. However, W3C will still
			participate in the development process of HTML.

			Before the ceding of authority, W3C and WHATWG had been characterized as both working together on the
			development of HTML 5,[11] and yet also at cross purposes ever since the July 2012 split, creating
			WHATWG. The W3C standard was snapshot-based and static, while the WHATWG is a continually updated "living
			standard". The relationship had been described as "fragile", even a "rift",[41] and characterized by
			"squabbling".

			In at least one case, namely the permissible content of the element, the two specifications directly
			contradicted each other (as of July 2018), with the W3C definition being permissive and reflecting
			traditional use of the element since its introduction,but WHATWG limiting it to a single defined
			type of content (the title of the work cited).This is actually at odds with WHATWG's stated goals
			of ensuring backward compatibility and not losing prior functionality.

			The "Introduction" section in the WHATWG spec (edited by Ian "Hixie" Hickson) is critical of W3C, e.g.
			"Note: Although we have asked them to stop doing so, the W3C also republishes some parts of this
			specification as separate documents." In its "History" subsection it portrays W3C as resistant to
			Hickson's and WHATWG's original HTML 5 plans, then jumping on the bandwagon belatedly (though Hickson
			was in control of the W3C HTML 5 spec, too). Regardless, it indicates a major philosophical divide
			between the organizations

					HTML 5 introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern

					The HTML 5 syntax is no longer based on SGML[88][89] despite the similarity of its markup. It has,
					however, been designed to be backward-compatible with common parsing of older versions of HTML. It
					comes with a new introductory line that looks like an SGM

					In addition to specifying markup, HTML 5 specifies scripting application programming interfaces

					extended and de facto features documented. There are also new APIs,
